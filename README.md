In the code
- Only top 10 results will be produced in the output
- I've used time.sleep(5) command to have a 5 seconds delay. 
- If you're not getting proper results change the timings to 10,12 seconds to produce a longer delay allowing the website to load the data.

<h1><u>Results</u></h1>

> Sucessful in extracting the data of first 10 results
